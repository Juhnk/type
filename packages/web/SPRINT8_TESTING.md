# Sprint 8: Punctuation & Numbers Enhancement Testing Guide

## Overview

Sprint 8 enhances TypeAmp's text generation with intelligent punctuation and numbers, creating realistic typing scenarios that mirror real-world text.

### Enhancements Implemented:

- **Backend API**: Enhanced `/api/words` endpoint with `punctuation`, `numbers`, and `punctuation_density` parameters
- **Server-side Text Generation**: Intelligent punctuation insertion with realistic patterns
- **Frontend Integration**: Enhanced API client and fallback text generation
- **Realistic Patterns**: Contractions, possessives, numbers, quotes, and advanced punctuation

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Backend API Testing

#### 1.1 Basic Punctuation Generation

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/words?list=english1k&limit=50&punctuation=true`

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "words": ["array", "of", "words"],
  "metadata": {
    "list": "english1k",
    "count": 50,
    "total_available": 1000
  },
  "enhanced_text": "Array of words with punctuation, contractions, and proper capitalization. This creates realistic typing scenarios!",
  "punctuation_enabled": true,
  "numbers_enabled": false
}
```

**Test Steps**:

1. Start API server: `PORT=3003 npm run dev` in packages/api
2. Test basic punctuation: `curl "http://localhost:3003/api/words?punctuation=true&limit=25"`
3. Verify response includes `enhanced_text` field
4. Check that punctuation patterns are realistic (periods, commas, apostrophes)

#### 1.2 Numbers Integration

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/words?punctuation=true&numbers=true&limit=30`

**Expected Patterns**:

- Years: "In 2023, the population reached..."
- Percentages: "Sales increased by 15.3% this quarter..."
- Prices: "The item costs $45.99 at the store..."
- Quantities: "We need 12 items for the project..."

**Test Steps**:

1. Enable both punctuation and numbers
2. Verify numbers appear in realistic contexts
3. Check number formatting (currency, percentages, etc.)

#### 1.3 Punctuation Density Levels

**Test Each Density**:

- `punctuation_density=light`: Minimal punctuation, mostly periods
- `punctuation_density=medium`: Balanced punctuation with commas, contractions
- `punctuation_density=heavy`: Rich punctuation with quotes, semicolons, parentheses

**Test Steps**:

1. Test each density level with same word list
2. Compare punctuation frequency across densities
3. Verify advanced punctuation (quotes, parentheses) appears in heavy mode

### 2. Frontend Integration Testing

#### 2.1 Punctuation Toggle in TypeAmp

**Test Steps**:

1. Start frontend: `npm run dev` in packages/web
2. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + K)
3. Toggle punctuation setting to ON
4. Start a new test in Words mode (25 words)
5. Verify text includes realistic punctuation patterns

**Expected Results**:

- Sentences with proper capitalization
- Commas in appropriate places
- Contractions (don't, can't, it's)
- Possessives (word's, company's)
- Question marks and exclamation points
- Numbers in context (when enabled)

#### 2.2 Cross-Mode Compatibility

**Test punctuation in each mode**:

**Words Mode (10/25/50/100 words)**:

- Enable punctuation toggle
- Start words test
- Verify punctuation appears consistently
- Check word boundaries work correctly with punctuation

**Time Mode (15s/30s/60s/120s)**:

- Enable punctuation toggle
- Start time test
- Verify auto-scrolling works with punctuation
- Check dynamic content generation includes punctuation

**Quote Mode**:

- Enable punctuation toggle
- Verify quote-like text generation
- Check sentence structure and flow

#### 2.3 Difficulty Mode Validation

**Expert Mode with Punctuation**:

1. Set difficulty to Expert
2. Enable punctuation
3. Start typing test with punctuation-heavy text
4. Intentionally make error in word with punctuation (e.g., "don't" → "dont")
5. Press space to submit incorrect word
6. **Expected**: Game fails with message showing incorrect word

**Master Mode with Punctuation**:

1. Set difficulty to Master
2. Enable punctuation
3. Start typing
4. Make error on punctuation character (e.g., type ';' instead of ',')
5. **Expected**: Game fails immediately with specific error message

### 3. UI/UX Testing

#### 3.1 Punctuation Visual Feedback

**Test Steps**:

1. Enable punctuation in Command Palette
2. Verify UI shows punctuation is active
3. Check that punctuation characters render correctly
4. Test character highlighting works with punctuation marks

#### 3.2 Statistics Accuracy

**Test Steps**:

1. Complete test with punctuation-heavy text
2. Verify WPM calculation includes punctuation characters
3. Check accuracy percentage accounts for punctuation
4. Ensure character counts are correct

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### 4.1 API Error Fallback

**Test Steps**:

1. Stop API server
2. Enable punctuation in frontend
3. Start new test
4. **Expected**: Frontend falls back to local punctuation generation
5. Verify fallback text still includes realistic punctuation

#### 4.2 Empty/Invalid Responses

**Test Steps**:

1. Test with invalid punctuation_density value
2. Test with limit=0
3. Verify proper error handling

#### 4.3 Special Character Handling

**Test punctuation with different word lists**:

- JavaScript keywords with punctuation
- Python keywords with punctuation
- Programming contexts with numbers and symbols

### 5. Performance Testing

#### 5.1 Text Generation Performance

**Test Steps**:

1. Request large word limits (1000+ words) with punctuation
2. Measure response times
3. Test auto-scrolling performance with punctuation-heavy text
4. Verify memory usage remains stable

#### 5.2 Real-time Typing Performance
